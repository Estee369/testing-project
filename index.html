            <h3 class="c-text">Become a full stack developer.</h3>
            <p class="text">I wants to be a full stake developer. Currently i am learning about html, css and github in
                programming
                hero course. I am pretty confident that i can master front end development within 3 months. After that i
                will try to learn about the backend side. But at first my first priority will be front end and getting a
                job from that only. I think this will not be very hard but will be a very interesting journy.</p>
