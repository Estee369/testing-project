            <p class="text">I wants to be a full stake developer. Currently i am learning about html, css and github in
                programming
                hero course. I am pretty confident that i can master front end development within 3 months. After that i
                will try to learn about the backend side. But at first my first priority will be front end and getting a
                job from that only. I think this will not be very hard but will be a very interesting journy.</p>

                <p>The back- end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database. A back-end developer
                    builds and maintains the technology that powers those components which, together, enable the
                    user-facing
                    side of the website to even exist in the first place.</p>
